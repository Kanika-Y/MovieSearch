# MOVIE LAND
Movie Land is a platform that gives us access to all the movies we search for. Eg, on searching for Superman we can get a list of all the Superman movies, and we can scroll through those. It is a fully mobile responsive application. Made use of an external API (OMDb). Covers some basic concepts of React, managing states, using different components, props etc.
